# Plantich – Cursor Project Rules

## Project Overview
This repository is **Plantich** - The Sacred Alchemy of Plants. A Nordic luxury herbal apothecary platform built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## File Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions, types, and data loaders
- `src/styles/` - Global styles and Tailwind configuration
- `content/` - Static content files (plants and remedies)
- `sanity/` - Sanity CMS schemas (for future use)

## Content Structure
- One file per entity under `/content/plants` and `/content/remedies`
- Export default objects matching `Plant` or `Remedy` types from `src/lib/types.ts`
- Use kebab-case slugs (e.g., `ashwagandha`, `anxiety`)
- Include research links and safety information

## Pages
- `/plants/[slug]` and `/remedies/[slug]` read from local content loaders
- Static generation with ISR (revalidate: 86400)
- SEO metadata generated via `src/lib/seo.ts`

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- shadcn/ui components when available
- Nordic minimalism × botanical apothecary aesthetic
- Keep design clean, premium, and botanical-inspired

## Code Quality
- Strong TypeScript typing - no `any` types
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Husky pre-push hooks for quality checks
- All text content in English first

## Performance
- Static generation preferred
- Minimal client-side JavaScript
- Optimized images with next/image
- No external API calls at runtime (build-time only)

## Content Guidelines
- Scientific, warm, inspiring tone
- Include research links for claims
- Add safety notes and contraindications
- Educational disclaimer on remedy pages
- Affiliate links only via `AffiliateBlock` component

## Development Workflow
- Use `npm run dev` for development
- `npm run build` for production builds
- `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript validation
- `npm run lint` for code quality checks

## Deployment
- Vercel deployment with GitHub integration
- Environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Automatic builds on push to main branch
